# Winter Mountaineering Policies

## Trip Classifications

### EasyEasy: 
 
- Single day hike avoiding inclement weather 
- Distance traveled not to exceed 8 miles 
- Non-technical gear use may be required, e.g. snowshoes and/or microspikes 
- Will not require technical gear 
- Maximum participant to leader (including assistant leader) ratio 8:2 
- Elevation gain around 1000 ft 
- Example trips: Green Mountains, Catskills, Lower Adirondack Peaks 
 
#### Summary
Participants of an easy winter mountaineering trip do not need to have any prior experience in winter mountaineering, but it is preferred if they have experience hiking. Easy trips are used to introduce hikers to the sport with minimal risk; altitude, terrain, and travel distance are minimized. These trips are only single day trips over moderate terrain in fair weather and may include instruction of the use of snowshoes and mountaineering boots. This is the introductory level. 

### Moderate

- Day, overnight, and selective multi night trips.  
- Moderate weather conditions avoiding extreme cold, snow, and wind 
- Distance up to 10 miles per day 
- Elevation gain around 2000 ft 
- Non-technical gear use may be required, e.g. snowshoes and/or microspikes 
- Will not require technical gear 
- Simple travel and route finding 
- Maximum participant to leader (including assistant leader) ratio is not to exceed 8:2 
- Example trips: Catskills, Lower White Mountains, and Adirondack Peaks 

#### Summary
Trips will range from beginner to moderate in potentially inclement weather conditions. Participants will need to have prior experience with hiking or backpacking, and some experience with winter mountaineering. Limited exposed travel will be done; camping will be done in protected areas.

### Difficult

- Day, single night or multi night trip in most types of weather including harsh wind, cold, and snow 
- Use of technical gear, potential for use of rope teams; demonstrations from leader 
- May include distance of up to 15 miles per day 
- Elevation gain greater than 2000 ft 
- Maximum participant to leader ratio 6:2 depending on participants experience level 
- Pack weights starting at 35 lb 
- Example trips: High Adirondack Peaks, White Mountains, Catskills 
- Potential for camping in more exposed areas.  

#### Summary
Difficult trips will be those with either difficult terrain, length, or a large number of days. Participants will have prior experience including an overnight and be physically capable of high mileages and long days. Participants may be taught and practice mountaineering skills such as self-arrest and self-belay. Weather can be potentially hazardous and terrain may require caution. Campsites may be marginally protected.


### Strenuous

- Day, single or multi night trips in steeper, varied terrain at higher altitude in potentially difficult weather
- May include distance greater than 15 miles per day
- Use of technical gear, potential for use of ropes with a qualified leader
- May require fixed roped sections
- Elevation gain greater than 3000 ft
- Pack weight starting from 50 lb
- Maximum participant to leader ratio 4:2 depending on skill level of participants
- Example trips: High Adirondack Peaks, Presidential Range, Katahdin, Presi Traverse

#### Summary
Trips that are strenuous can include steep elevation gain, fast pace, high pack weight, difficult weather, and altitude. Participants should have solid winter mountaineering experience and have been on overnight trips in the past and should be physical capable of daily challenges. Knowledge of mountaineering skills and risk-management is required. These trips may include fixed roped sections, use of technical gear, high class terrain, and camping in exposed sites. Knowledge of the use of technical gear is required.
