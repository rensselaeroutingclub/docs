 # Climbing Wall Policies
 
 ## General
 
**Note: No roped climbing is allowed in the gym. Bouldering only.**

- Only wall leaders may hold wall hours 
- There must be two leaders present to hold wall hours 
    - Either two wall leaders, or one wall leader and an assistant wall leader  
        - To be an assistant wall leader one must have CPR and first aid 
Assistant wall leadership does not equal wall leadership (a wall leader must be present for an assistant leader to open the wall) 
Wall leadership is separate from other climbing leadership (climbing leaders cannot open the wall unless they are wall leaders)

- Only paid ROC members may access the wall during regular wall hours 
    - The wall is open to all members of the rpi community during ​open​ wall hours 
- All new routes must be approved or set by a wall leader 
    - If they are deemed unsafe by a leader or the wall chair, they will be removed  
    - Dynos and bat hangs are not to be used in routes 
    - Routes may not be set over the doorway

## Wall Leadership

- Have climbed in the wall, and the leader at that time must be present during election  
- Have CPR and First Aid 
- Have knowledge of: 
    - Intermediate climbing techniques (such as mantles, crimps, proper foot work,e.g. heel/toe hook). 
    - How to quickly obtain help in the 87 Gym in the case of an emergency. 
    - How to instruct beginners in spotting, training, and climbing basics. 
    - How to handle a situation where someone isn’t adhering to the rules. 
    - How many people can be climbing at once.  
    - How many people can be in the wall at a given time. 
    - How to put the mats up at the end of the day 
    - The climbing shoe rental policy (rental shoes that are in the ROC wall ​cannot​ be taken outside)
- Be able to demonstrate strong leadership skills and be comfortable being in charge of a group of people. 
- Know what to do in the event of an injury 
- Be able to hold at least one wall hour a week 
    - Understand that if they do not hold their wall hours for an extended period of time their leadership may be suspended 
- Assist with wall maintenance and cleaning as directed by wall chair 

**Note: Wall leadership is an active leadership.**
If a wall leader does not fulfill the requirements of their leadership as described above, the wall chair and executive committee may suspend that leadership. In order to reinstate suspended wall leadership, the leader in question must write a letter to the executive committee describing why they should be reinstated.

For example: If your wall leadership was suspended because you were not able to hold hours describe how you have remedied that. "I now have a two hour block between classes on Wednesdays and an assistant leader is willing to hold wall hours with me at that time."
