### Demonstrate Technique

- General
  - Braking: brake gradually, with pulsed inputs to avoid locked brake slides. Do not rapidly apply front brake 
  - Maintain level feet whenever not actively pedaling 
- Descent
  - Higher gear for higher speed 
  - Low center of gravity, muscles loose to absorb impact, often slightly above seat 
- Ascent
  - Lower gear for greater torque 
  - Proper weight distribution, maintain weight on back wheel for traction while pressing handlebars down to keep front wheel grounded 
  - Typically hold body higher, more forward than riding downhill or flat 
- Obstacles
  - Judge whether or not the bike has sufficient clearance to ride an obstacle. If not, ride around remaining on trail, or carry bike over obstacle. 
  - Remain low over the bike. Keep body loose to allow bike movement with minimum body movement 
  - Avoid significant pedaling inputs, and keep feet flat as possible

### Understanding of Trail Etiquette
- Yielding right of way
  - Hikers always have right of way. Step off of bike and move to side of trail 
  - Horses always have right of way. Retreat as far from trail as possible while respecting LNT principles. 
  - Ascending mountain biker has right of way over a descending mountain biker, but must forfeit right of way to non-biking parties. Step off of bike and move to side of trail. 
  - When yielding to a hiker or biker, keep bike tires on trail if possible. Lean against a tree while doing so. If necessary, leave trail carrying bike. Do not ride bike off of trail. In double track, ride on the right side of the trail 
- When passing another rider
  - Pass on the left when possible 
  - Politely communicate intent to pass to other rider

  - Pass at reasonably slow speed 
- When passing a hiker

  - Communicate intent to pass 
  - On single track/narrow trails, dismount bike and walk/carry bike past hiker 
- Do not ride when trails are wet or muddy, especially when riding in large groups
