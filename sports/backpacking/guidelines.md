# Backpacking Policies

## Trip Classifications

### Easy

- Single day hike in good weather avoiding inclement weather.
- Distance traveled not to exceed 8 miles
- Maximum participant to leader (including assistant leader) ratio 8:2
- Example trips: Grafton Lake, Green Mountains, Catskills, Berkshire Hills, Taconic Hills, Lower Adirondack peaks

#### Abstract
Participants of an easy backpacking trip need not to have any prior experience in hiking or backpacking. Used to introduce hikers to the sport with minimal risk, altitude and travel distance is limited. These trips are only single day trips over moderate terrain in fair weather. This is the beginner level.

### Moderate

- Day, single night and selective multi night trips in fair weather conditions avoiding extreme cold, wind, and water when possible.
- Distance up to 10-12 miles per day
- Simple travel and route finding
- Maximum participant to leader (including assistant leader) ratio is not to exceed 8:2
- Example trips: Green Mountains, Catskills, Berkshire Hills, and High Adirondack Peaks

#### Abstract
Trips will range from beginner to moderate in potentially inclement conditions. Participants will sometimes need to have prior experience with hiking or backpacking. No high altitude travel will be done.

### Difficult

- Day, single night or multi night trip in most types of weather including rain, cold, and snow. 
- Distance up to 15 miles per day
- Elevation gain of over 1800ft in 2 miles
- Maximum participant to leader ratio 6:2 or 8:2 depending on participants experience level 
- Pack weights starting at 30lbs
- Example trips: High Adirondack Peaks, White Mountains, Catskills

#### Abstract
Difficult trips will be those with either difficult terrain or length of stay. Participants should have prior experience with overnights and be physically capable of daily mileages. Weather can be potentially hazardous and in moderate winter conditions not requiring the use of snowshoes or crampons.

### Strenuous

- Day, single or multi night trips possibly at higher altitude in potentially difficult weather conditions including snow (not needing mountaineering gear such as crampons, snowshoes etc.)
- Distance of up to 20 miles per day
- Elevation gain of greater than 2000ft in 2 miles
- Pack weight varying from 35 lbs or more
- Maximum participant to leader ratio 4:2 or 6:2 depending on skill level of participants
- Example trips: High Adirondack Peaks, White Mountains, Catskills and other ranges around the world

#### Abstract
Trips that are strenuous can include elevation gain, fast pace, high pack weight, difficult weather and altitude. Participants should have solid experience and have been on overnight trips in the past and in physical shape to be capable of daily mileages.
