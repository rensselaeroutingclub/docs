# Bouldering

## General

There must be at least 3 people on any bouldering trip. There may be one active climber on the problem at a time, with at least 2 other individuals spotting. Participants can be of any level, but the trip leader has the right to decide who is allowed on the trip based on the difficulty of the planned problems and the participants’ level of experience. Trip size is limited by the number of crashpads, the group’s location, and ability to not interfere with other climbers. Maximum ratio of participants to leaders is 8:2 and the maximum number of participants is 10.

**Note: Highballs (bouldering problems higher than 20 feet) are not allowed on club trips**

## Classification of Trips

### Beginner (V0, V1)

- Beginner problems (V0, V1)
- Large, open, level landing area

Beginner trips serve as an introduction to outdoor bouldering. These trips teach participants how to spot and place crashpads to protect falls. Participants do not need prior climbing experience, but are encouraged to visit the Wall in the ‘87 gym before going on the trip.

### Intermediate (V2, V3)

- Intermediate problems (V2, V3)
- Possible uneven landing area

Intermediate trips require participants to be able to move crash pads and spot the climber with direction from the leader. Prior climbing experience is strongly recommended, as otherwise participants will not be able to complete or enjoy problems.

### Advanced (V4+)

- Harder problems (V4+)
- Uneven or awkward landing area with small space

Advanced trips require participants to have extensive prior climbing experience. Participants should be comfortable spotting and placing pads in a variety of conditions and surfaces.

## Classification of Leaders
