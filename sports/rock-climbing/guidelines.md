# Rock Climbing

Outdoor rock climbing is an incredibly rewarding sport. Climbers can test their physical and mental limits while enjoying the great outdoors. Climbing has the potential to be dangerous. Key considerations need to be made to ensure that club trips are as safe as possible. The following guidelines are to be followed at all club affiliated climbing events.  

This document is separated into two sections. The first section, Guiding Principles, outlines the overarching ideas and expectations that are supported by the second section, Guidelines. That section details specific rules, procedures, and best practices for the outdoor rock climbing activity. The spirit and specifics of both sections should be followed on all outing club climbing trips.  

## Guiding Principles

### Leadership Statement

Due to the highly variable nature of weather conditions, climbing areas, participant skill level, and other factors, climbing leaders are held to a higher standard. Participants directly rely on the trip leader’s expertise to keep them safe. For this reason, the leadership process is very involved, and to maintain leadership one must possess and demonstrate both technical proficiency and good judgement. Leaders that do not maintain their abilities will have their leadership sanctioned as no participant should doubt that their trip leader will keep them safe.  
Additionally, the rock climbing chair must be a rock climbing leader.  Only If no leader wishes to run for the position, should the position be filled by a non-leader.  

### Risk Management

The climbing leadership process emphasizes a well-rounded approach to risk-management. Conditions outside can change at any moment among many other factors that effect a leader’s ability to mitigate risk. A leader needs to have both the good judgement and experience necessary to observe, understand, and react to different risk factors. This is especially true in environments where multiple risk factors are present. Leaders are expected to recognize the risks they may face during their trips and be able to confidently determine the best course of action.  

Leaders should have a strong grasp of the risk management principles taught in the required Rocksport course and the leadership checklist.  

### Etiquette

Maintaining good crag etiquette is a critical part of keeping climbing areas available to the club and preserving their integrity. Every climbing community has their own views on how to act at their crag. Their guidelines, which sometimes seem pedantic, are generally based on years of experience climbing at the crag. For example, some areas have designated rappelling sites to preserve trees and to prevent climbers from approaching unseen and unstable edges. It is up to trip leaders to research and follow crag etiquette to the best of their ability. This means the etiquette and ethics of some crags may preclude club trips. Otherwise, there are several outing club standards that should be followed on all trips. Club policies such as leave-no-trace where club groups should never pollute or deface any natural site should always be followed. When able, groups should rectify any environmental issues they find on their trip such as picking up trash they find.  

## Guidelines

### Specific Rules

1. Everyone shall wear helmets while climbing or near the base of a cliff.
2. Nobody shall approach the edge of a cliff without appropriate protection.
3. No climbing during severe weather conditions.
4. Only leaders and assistant leaders may lead climb.
5. No bouldering unless the trip is also a designated bouldering trip.
6. Anchor systems should minimally be strong, redundant, and follow current accepted best practices.
7. Anchor systems shall not be composed entirely of traditional climbing gear. They shall contain either a bolt or a monolithic component such as a large tree.
8. Non-leaders rappelling (without a belay) is only allowed on advanced trips.
9. Only sport climbing and top roping is allowed. No traditional (trad) or mixed sport/trad climbing. Trad gear can be used 10. to make routes safer but should only supplement existing fixed protection.
11. Participants should remain under the supervision of trip leaders.
12. Follow crag etiquette. For example, be courteous and do not crowd popular routes.
13. No climbing at night.
14. No multipitch climbing.

### Trip Classifications

Trip difficulty is dependent on a variety of factors such as weather, crowding, approach, and location. The classifications below are based on a normal temperature range (40 – 85 degrees Fahrenheit) and optimal weather conditions (low chance of precipitation and no high wind). Trips outside of these conditions should be rescheduled or the trip difficulty should be raised. Trips to scout new climbing areas are always considered to be advanced difficulty. The maximum ratio of participants to leaders is 6:2, and the maximum number of attendees can be found on the list of scouted areas.  

#### Beginner (<5.8)

These trips are intended to introduce climbers to the outdoor setting. Significant time may be allocated to teaching participants skills such as leave no trace, crag etiquette, belaying, and technique. These trips should occur at familiar climbing areas.  

##### Individual Gear

- Helmet
- Harness
- Climbing Shoes
- Closed Toed Shoes
- Weather Appropriate Clothing
- Water and Food
- Appropriately Sized Pack
- Sunscreen and Bug Spray

##### Group Gear

- Chalk Bags
- Belay Devices
- First Aid Kit
- Slings
- Ropes
- Anchor Bulding Material
- Basic Rescue Materials
- Quickdraws
- Locking Carabiners
- Emergeny Rappel Anchor Setup
- *See Area Specific Gear*

#### Intermediate (<5.10)

These trips are intended for climbers who are more familiar with outdoor climbing. Less time will be spent on easier routes and participants are generally expected to be able to belay, hike longer approaches, and deal with more strenuous conditions.  

##### Individual Gear

- All From Beginner Gear
- Tether Setup
- Belay Device w/ Carabiner

##### Group Gear

- All From Beginner Gear
- *See Area Specific Gear*

#### Advanced (>=5.10)

These trips are intended for experienced outdoor climbers. Participants should be capable climbers that are familiar with climbing technique, belaying, and are able to practice higher levels of personal risk management. Advanced trips may be scouting new areas that the club has not yet documented. Just because a trip is at an advanced level, does not mean safety considerations regarding conditions, location, etcetera can be ignored.  

##### Individual Gear

- All From Intermediate Gear
- Tether and Rappel Setup

##### Group Gear

- All From Intermediate Gear
- Trad Gear
- *See Area Specific Gear*

### Scouting Trips

Non-advanced trips should only be taken to areas that the club has previously been to, and that current club members are familiar with. Otherwise, a scouting trip should be taken to scout out to the new climbing area. A scouting trip is a well-planned advanced level trip where considerations will be made towards group size, bringing extra gear, and the possibility of not being able to climb at all. Upon returning from a scouting trip, the trip leader can add the new location to the scouted areas sheet.  

### Leadership Process

The goal of the leadership process is to create a well-rounded climbing leader that not only has independently verified life-safety skills, but also has had the opportunity to apprentice under a current climbing leader and learn more advanced skills that are relevant to running club climbing trips. There are several major steps in the leadership process.

#### Pre-Rocksport Course

Before members take the Rocksport course they should be familiar with the course’s requirements as well as meet its [prerequisite requirements](./course_guidelines.md). Ideally, everyone that attends the Rocksport course will have the foundations to succeed and pass the course. Candidates must also have Wilderness First Aid, CPR, and Outdoor Wilderness Leadership.  

#### Rocksport Course

This is a critical part of the leadership process. An independent entity, Rocksport, teaches a course with AMGA certified rock guides containing important life safety skills. Those skills include site safety, group considerations, risk management, leave no trace, bolted anchors, cleaning anchors, rappelling with a third hand, and belay exchanges with a tensioned rope. This is followed by a day practicing and demonstrating these skills in an outdoor environment. Participants must show proficiency to pass the Rocksport course and complete this requirement.  

The intent of having candidates take this course is to provide a base level of life-safety skills taught by an independent entity ensuring that candidates at least have skills to keep themselves safe while outdoor climbing. It will also introduce leading climbing groups.  This is the strong foundation that the rest of the leadership process builds from.  

#### Assistant Leadership

Those who have passed the Rocksport course can become an assistant leader. They will be quizzed not only on the material from the course, but also on all the club policies, rules, and guidelines that they will have to know to become a full rock climbing leader. Assistant leaders will assist leaders in taking out climbing trips. During that time, they will work to fulfill the requirements outlined in the leadership checklist which mainly build off the skills learned in the Rocksport course. This part of the process is essentially an apprenticeship, where not only do candidates learn new skills, but climbing leaders can evaluate them.  

#### Full Leadership

To become a climbing leader candidates must complete a leadership checklist, have experience leading groups outdoor climbing, and have intimate knowledge of this document. Candidates will not just have completed the checklist, but they also must have the confidence of those certifying their leadership.  

As stated in the leadership statement, leaders must maintain their skills and the confidence of participants and club members. Failure to do so means their leadership will be sanctioned.  

#### Commentary on the Leadership Process

The leadership process is intentionally designed to be time consuming and intensive. This is to give time for candidates to gain experience and process the new skills they will learn. The idea is to create well rounded climbing leaders that have had their base level life-safety skills taught and vetted by an external and qualified organization. Their time as an assistant leader will give them important experience leading outdoor climbing trips and will also teach them skills that add an extra layer of capability. At the end of this process leaders should have the necessary skillset and experience to safely lead outdoor climbing trips with a variety of participants.  

### Trip Flow

Rock climbing trips will all follow a general format. It is important that from the moment people start signing up for the trip, to the time they get back to RPI, that strong communication is maintained. It is helpful to create a group chat where members that have signed up may communicate about the trip.  

#### Trip Announcement

The trip will be announced including the location, its difficulty, and any pertinent information. A signup date will also be established as the last day that people can join the trip. It is important that people are not joining the trip so late that it cannot be properly planned.  

#### Gear Retrieval

Well before the trip goes out, members of the trip should be told what gear they need. Individual gear should be checked out by them or in their name. Group gear should also be checked out.  

Gear should be inspected to make sure it is in acceptable condition for the trip.  

#### Trip Sheet

The climbing trip sheet should be created and submitted.  

#### Trip Day

A meeting place and time should have been established. Also, the drivers should have been selected. The trip leader should take time to brief their group, lay out rules such as leave no trace and crag etiquette, and ensure that everyone has the necessary gear. Then everyone gets to have fun on their trip.  

#### After

SWOT analysis needs to be completed for the trip, and any injuries or broken gear need to be properly reported. Gear will be properly put away at the pit.  

### Scouted Areas

After a scouting trip has been taken to a new or unfamiliar area, and if the leader and chair concur, the climbing area can be added to the scouted areas list.

The list is can be found here: [scouted-areas.md](./scouted-areas.md)

#### Example: Thacher State Park

| Area Name | Scouts | Max Attendees | Scouting Date | Minimum Trip Level |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| Example - Thacher State Park | Nick Meyer & Brian Anderson | 8 | 7/5/2019 | Beginner |    

##### General Notes
This crag has routes that are mostly harder than 5.8, is very popular, and has an easy approach. Thacher is also chossy and the belay areas can be very small. Make sure that extra slings are brought as tethers for bags and stuff around edges. Anchors are bolted.   

##### Access Notes
Climbing is free, but participants need to sign a waiver and get a permit. This requires a photo ID. Parking is $6. You will be ticketed.
