# Scouted Areas

After a scouting trip has been taken to a new or unfamiliar area, the climbing area can be added to the scouted areas list if the leader and chair concur.

## Thacher State Park

| Area Name | Scouts | Max Attendees | Scouting Date | Minimum Trip Level |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| Thacher State Park | Nick Meyer & Brian Anderson | 8 | 7/5/2019 | Beginner |    

### General Notes
This crag has routes that are mostly harder than 5.8, is very popular, and has an easy approach. Thacher is also chossy and the belay areas can be very small. Make sure that extra slings are brought as tethers for bags and stuff around edges. Anchors are bolted.   

### Access Notes
Climbing is free, but participants need to sign a waiver and get a permit. This requires a photo ID. Parking is $6. You will be ticketed.
