# Ice Climbing Policies

## General

The activity of ice climbing focuses solely on the ascension of inclined ice formations where roped and protected climbing is crucial. This activity is separate from mountaineering. The skills involved in ice climbing, however, stem from both rock climbing and mountaineering. The trip leader reserves the right to decide who can participate in club trips based on the participant's ability and the skill required. 

__Note: Lead ice climbing is not allowed on any club trips, nor should any club gear be used for lead ice climbing.__

## Classification of Trips

### Easy-Moderate

1. Top-roping trips on WI 2 to WI 4 ice formations. 
2. Participants are taught basic ice climbing techniques such as tripod formation, ice tool use, crampon kicking, and finding rests. 
3. Participants are instructed on proper ice climbing safety, such as proper climber-belayer communication. In addition participants will be made familiar with common hazards encountered on trips such as ice falls. 
4. Participants could be taught rappelling 
5. Trips will be in safe, approachable locations. 

### Moderate-Difficult

1. Participants must meet all requirements of a easy-moderate trip. 
2. Top-roping trips on WI 4 to WI 5 ice formations. 
3. Participants must have demonstrated prior climbing experience and must have demonstrated how to properly belay and tie-in. 
4. Participants may receive more advanced instruction on the topics covered on beginner- intermediate trips. 
5. Participants could be taught more advanced ice climbing techniques, and top-rope anchor building. 

## Classification of Leaders

### Assistant Leader

All assistant leaders must: 
1. Have current CPR and WFA 
2. Have gone on a previous ROC ice climbing trip 
3. Be able to teach common ice climbing techniques. These techniques include: 
    - Belaying 
    - Tie-in 
    - Tripod formation 
    - Ice tool swinging 
    - Crampon kicking 
    - Finding rests 
4. Be able to climb at least a WI 4 successfully without falling. 
5. Identify and teach proper ice climbing communication. 
6. Be aware of the basic elements of ice climbing safety, such as: 
  - Avoiding ice falls 
  - Rope handling 
  - Rope management 
7. Know how to handle ice climbing related medical emergencies (ex. screaming barfies, hypothermia, etc.) 

### Leader

All leaders must meet the requirements of the assistant leader position, and in addition must: 
1. Be able to teach more advanced ice climbing techniques. These techniques include: 
  - French technique 
  - Stemming 
  - Basic dry-tooling 
2. Be prepared for emergency scenarios, including: 
  - Knowing how to tie a swiss seat harness 
  - Knowing how to tie and belay on a munter hitch (lack of a belay device) 
3. Know how to rappel and tie a prusik or autoblock knot as a backup.
4. Be able to rig a proper top roping anchor following S.E.Re.NE 
5. Know how to incorporate directionals into creating an ice climbing anchor, such as through the use of ice screws. 
  - Anchors cannot be made up entirely of ice screws 
6. Know when to and be able to sharpen crampons and ice tools. 
7. Know the proper equipment to be used 

## Recommended Equipment

It is recommended that the following items be brought on every ice climbing trip. 
1. Ice tools 
2. Crampon adaptable boots 
3. Ice climbing crampons 
4. Harness 
5. Helmet 
6. Anchor building equipment: 
  - Webbing/slings 
  - Carabiners 
  - P-cord 
7. Belay device 
8. Warm, waterproof, synthetic clothing (including hat and gloves) 
9. First aid kit 
10. Emergency blanket 
11. Sunglasses/goggles 
12. Food/water 

## Ice Climbing Chair

The ice climbing chair shall be appointed by the Executive Committee. The chair should have at least some familiarity with ice climbing and should be able to identify and explain the use of ALL gear commonly used on ice climbing trips. Furthermore, the chair MUST be able to: 
1. Inventory all ice climbing equipment at least once per semester. 
2. Maintain and repair all ice climbing equipment as needed  
3. Develop and get approval for the yearly ice climbing budget. 
4. Buy all gear as approved in the budget. 
5. Revise the ice climbing policy as needed or when requested to by the Executive Council.
