# Rensselaer Outing Club Repository Guidelines

These guidelines define how the the Rensselaer Outing Club Documents repository should be used.

## Policies

1. Do not commit directly to the main branch.
2. Follow the [making changes](#making-changes) workflow below to make changes.
3. Guidelines and other written materials should be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) so they may be easily modified.

## Issues

Issues are used to track progress, ask questions, and make suggestions.

## Making Changes

Only cohesive changes should be made within the same workflow. For example, changing the wording of a sentence in the climbing guidelines. Changes requiring approvals from different parties like changes to both the climbing guidelines and kayaking guidelines should be separated into multiple workflows.

This workflow allows for anyone to propose changes to ROC policies. If your changes are accepted by the E-Comm, chair, or responsible party, your pull request will be approved and the changes will be integrated with the main branch. Reviewers may also respond with requests before they approve changes.

To make changes to any aspect of the repository follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch
2. Make proposed changes
3. Commit changes with a descriptive commit message
4. Create a pull request detailing changes and assign appropriate parties to review the request
5. Wait for approval, feedback, or rejection
